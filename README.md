## HackerNews Reader for Android 

Why another HN app? Well, we've tried several of HN app out there in Google Play Store, but we never found the one that suits our taste, so we build one! 
Pumpkin Reader is the manifestation of what we see the ideal HN app for our needs.

### Features (v1.0):

1. Material design, done right
2. Color coded, hierarchical comments
3. Readable, clean UI
4. All the features from HN API (read only, limitation of HN API)
