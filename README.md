## HackerNews Reader for Android 

[![Get it on Google Play](https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_60.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.pumpkinz.pumpkinreader)

Why another HN app? Well, we've tried several of HN app out there in Google Play Store, but we never found the one that suits our taste, so we build one! 

Pumpkin Reader is the manifestation of what we see the ideal HN app for our needs.

We only support Android 4.4+ because we believe that fragmentation in Android world is really bad. Hence the only way to go is to quickly abandon the older and now irrelevant versions.

## Features:

1. Material design, done right
2. Color coded, hierarchical comments
3. Readable, clean UI
4. Lovely dark theme
5. All the features from HN API (read only, limitation of HN API)
6. Integrated web view
7. Customizable - we're constantly adding new options
8. Ability to save HN news
